# Intro

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. One need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

# Description

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

## Files in the repository

* **data**: Folder with sample of the data
* **etl.py**: Loads the data from S3 to a cluster and saves into another S3 bucket.

## Run scripts

```bash
python3 etl.py
```
