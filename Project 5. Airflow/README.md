### Introduction
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more 
automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the 
conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse 
in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of CSV logs that tell about user 
activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

### Description

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
